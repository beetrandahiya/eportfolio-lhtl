            <h1>Introduction and Importance of Learning</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this week we focused on learning by inquiry or to say in simple terms by asking question about
                something we are curious about and about our environment.<br>
                We also learned the process of how to learn through inquiry. In this week we also have some activities.


                <br>
                Unlearning is the process of removing knowledge from our memory in order to make room for new knowledge.
                <br>

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3>and Yes, Unlearning is mostly Unpleasent</h3>

                Because the realization that , what we have learned is not good enough to be useful,<br>
                or the realization that, what you had immense belief in is not in fact the right thing <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                and, Here we must ask ourselves,<br>
                <h3>What even is "Learning"?</h3><br>
                In simple words, Learning is the process of acquiring <br>
                new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.<br>
                heads up, Learning is not just studying.<br>
                Learning involves experiencing new ideas and growing with them.<br>
                Learning involves absorbing the knowledge that we come across.<br>
                Learning involves adapting new ways of thinking and acting.<br>
                and most importantly, Learning involves being open to change.<br>
                and as mentioned earlier,<br>
                Studying is a very small part of learning and not synonymous with learning.<br>

            <h1>Learning Through Inquiry</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                I discovered what inquiry-based learning entails.<br>
                It's a method of instruction that encourages pupils to engage in problem-solving and hands-on learning.
                <br>
                It consists of five steps: "asking, investigating, creating, discussing, and reflecting" (conclusion).
                <br>
                "Curiosity" is also the driving force behind discovery, inquiry, and learning. Inquiry-based learning,
                in my opinion, is a really successful way. It is a problem-based learning approach that incorporates
                critical thinking abilities. "Tell me and I forget," "Show me or Teach me and I will remember," and
                "Involve me and I will learn."

                Inquiry-based learning is essentially asking questions and seeking knowledge, and it develops the habit
                of inquiring. It aids in the retention of knowledge. When we actively pursue details, explore
                information, or investigate a subject, we recall more information, which is exactly what inquiry-based
                learning is supposed to achieve.

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>


                <h3>Curiosity is the key to learning</h3>
                When we are curious about something that we are unaware about, we search about it through many means
                such as asking or looking it up on internet any many more.<br>
                This process of being curious and then investigating about the answer is known as learning by inquiry.
                When we are interested in something and we are unaware about it,<br>
                there are questions that pop out in our mind such as what? why? where? when? and many others, after the
                question comes the part where we want to know more and that's what we learn through inquiry,<br>
                learning is such a way also helps us retain the memory about our finding on that subject for a long
                time.<br>

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3> Inquiry based Learning</h3>
                <br>
                Inquiry-based learning is a learning process that engages students by making real-world connections
                through exploration and high-level questioning<br><br>

                <h3>1. Discussion on picture</h3>
                <img src="w2a1.jpeg" width="40%"><br>

                In this activity we were shown this picture in class and asked to describe this picture according to our
                perspective and talk about the things we were curious about in this picture.<br>
                It was an amazing activity as every other student had their own understanding of this picture through
                their own perspective. According to me, it was a very which not only gave us an great example of
                learning through inquiry.

                <br>In this activity we were shown the trailer of the movie "Social Dilemma" and were asked about our
                reviews on it.<br>
                As per my understanding, it shows us the dark side of the social media and how it has the ability to
                influence the minds of the general population.<br>
                It also tells us about how whatever we do can be tracked on the internet and is unsafe for us. On social
                media we do not have the privacy that we think that we do.<br>
                Even after knowing all about it we still use the social media sites as we are already quite addicted to
                them and removing them from our daily lives makes us uncomfortable and affects daily life
                convenience.<br>
                This activity was discussed in class and students were asked to give their views on it.<br>

                With the vast amount of information currently disseminated on the Internet,<br> the ability to assess
                the credibility of online news has become essential.<br>
                While numerous researches also include fake news and tools for best discrimination, there is one caveat.
                A measure that focuses on using the data area to facilitate the task of the database data and messages
                on the Internet.<br>
                to support claims and assess the credibility of disputes. The motivation behind this test is to examine
                the current state of information on the use of basic speculations to detect fake news.<br>
                evaluate the validity of the information and, in particular, determine what has been done concerning the

                <br>
                Process of critical thinking can be broken down into:

                <br>
                IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF AN IDEA THAT SUGGESTS ITSELF AS A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM IS UNCRITICAL THINKING.
                <br>
                There are three types of uncritical thinking in which people don't use their own brain they just follow
                others.<br>
                1.THE BANDWAGON FALLACY : In this people just follow the certain group without knowing the real
                information.<br>
                2.THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY FALLACY : In this people just blindly follow what the fake experts try to make
                believe you. no matter what is the real fact.<br>
                3.THE HASTY GENERALIZATION FALLACY : In this one follow what the majority of peoplethinks or say,
                irrespective of the real world. <br>

                My understanding of the four types of inquiries and their relevance in different stages of the learning
                journey?<br>
                Inquiry-based learning (additionally inquiry-based learning) begins by offering conversation starters,
                issues, or situations—instead of essentially introducing set up realities or depicting a smooth way to
                information. <br>

                <br>


                Inquiry learning includes creating questions, mentioning objective facts, doing research to discover
                what data is now recorded, creating strategies for tests, creating instruments for information
                assortment, gathering, investigating, and deciphering information, plotting potential clarifications,
                and making expectations for future examination.<br>
                <br>

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                Explicit learning measures that understudies take part in during request learning include:<br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    · Creating inquiries of their own<br>

                    · Obtaining supporting proof to answer the question(s)<br>

                    · Explaining the proof gathered<br>

                    · Connecting the clarification to the information got from the analytical cycle<br>

                    · Creating a contention and avocation for the clarification<br>

                </p>

                <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>

                <h3>Level 1: Structured Inquiry:</h3>

                The educator gives the underlying inquiry and a layout of the system.<br> Understudies are to define
                clarifications of their discoveries through assessing and investigating the information that they
                gather.

                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Level 2: Controlled Inquiry:</h3>

                The educator has instructed a specific science topic or point. The instructor at that point creates
                questions and a methodology that guides understudies through an activity where the outcomes are now
                known.<br> This strategy is extraordinary to fortify ideas instructed and to acquaint understudies into
                learning with follow techniques, gather and record information accurately and affirm and extend
                understandings.<br>
                <br>

                <h3>Level 3: Guided Inquiry:</h3>

                The instructor gives just the examination question to the understudies. The understudies are liable for
                planning and following their own methods to test that address and afterward impart their outcomes and
                discoveries.<br><br>

                <h3>Level 4: Free Inquiry:</h3>

                Understudies figure their own examination question(s), plan and finish a created strategy, and impart
                their discoveries and results. This sort of request is regularly found in science reasonable settings
                where understudies drive their own analytical inquiries.

            <h1>Learning Process</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are six interactive components of the learning process: attention, memory, language, processing,
                <br>and organizing, graphomotor (writing), and higher-order thinking.These processes interact not only
                with each other,<br>
                but also with emotions, classroom climate, behavior, social skills, teachers, and family. <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3>Attention</h3>
                Focusing is the preliminary section in getting the grasp of anything. It is easy for huge component
                folks to attention to matters which might be charming or energizing to us.<br>
                It is difficult for huge component folks to attention to matters which might be sincerely not. When
                something is not exciting to us, it's miles easier to get occupied, to transport to a moreover animating
                difficulty or action, or dam out.<br>
                The instructor must increase physical games that accomplice with the student. Relating what's to be
                knowledgeable to the understudies' lives can obtain this. Relate Romeo and Juliet, for instance, to the
                actual elements in our networks of bias, unwarranted contempt, and posse wars. Or however relate the
                prevailing segregation to The Diary of Anne Frank, and feature elegant conversations of separation that
                understudies have surely skilled or seen.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>Memory</h3>
                Memory is the puzzling cycle that makes use of 3 systems to assist someone with getting, using, storing,
                and getting well facts. Youths in faculty want to do not forget altogether extra facts reliably than
                maximum adults do. Adults typically have extra particular days mechanics use and evaluation mechanical
                facts, dental specialists use and do not forget facts approximately dentistry, and so forth, Of course,
                faculty expects that youngsters end up specialists in more than one subject e.g., math, language,
                science, social assessments, an difficult to understand tongue, human articulations. <br>
                Recall that after an understudy receives something, it does not assure that he's going to do not forget
                it. For example, a man or woman may also draw close a shaggy dog story that he heard at a social event
                on Saturday night, but he may also stumble upon a problem reviewing that it whilst he endeavors to
                inspire it to his associates on Monday.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Language</h3>
                Language is the basic strategy by which we give and get information in school.<br> The two languages
                taking care of systems are expressive and open.
                Most understudies, especially those with inadequacies in made language, will benefit by using a
                masterminding technique for both logical and exploratory composition.<br>
                With this system, understudies at first produce considerations. Next, they may organize their
                contemplations. Third, they may see sentence structure. By then they take a gander at their spelling.
                Finally, they deal with mechanical and syntactic rules.<br>
                It is in like manner valuable for understudies to list their most as frequently as conceivable happening
                goofs in a diary and imply this summary when self-redressing.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>Organization</h3>
                We measure and sort out information in two guideline ways: coordinated (spatial) and reformist
                (sequential).<br>
                Practicing accommodating learning grants each understudy's dealing with and figuring out characteristics
                to be utilized to the upside of the social occasion. For example, the people who are strong in
                simultaneous affiliation may make the get-together's blueprint, visual, or map, and those strong in
                reformist affiliation may be the task step facilitators, the military instructors, watches, and speed
                setters.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Higher-Order Thinking</h3>
                Higher solicitation/order thinking (HOT) is beyond simply recalling real factors or related information
                in the same words the educator or book sends them. Higher solicitation thinking requires that we achieve
                something with current real factors. We need to understand and control the information.<br>
                HOT joins thought plan; thought affiliation; basic reasoning; understanding the "higher point of view";
                envisioning; creativity; tending to; determining; innovative, smart, and feasible thinking; and
                metacognition.<br> Metacognition is mulling over deduction, pondering knowing, and knowing how you
                think, measure information, and learn.<br>
                All understudies will benefit by advance facilitators that relate the higher point of view and the
                standard plans to be covered. Moreover, all understudies ought to be unequivocally urged how to gather
                thought maps (reasonable organizers that partner all pieces of a thought, and may in like manner
                interface one plan to another thought).<br>

                Language can also additionally sincerely affect the manner that we think, a notion referred to as
                semantic determinism.<br>
                One past due displaying of this surprise blanketed contrasts withinside the way that English and
                Mandarin Chinese audio systems communicate and bear in mind time.
                English audio system will in widespread talk-time utilize phrases that depict adjustments alongside a
                flat measurement, for instance, pronouncing something like "I'm walking delayed" or "Don't lose song of
                the primary difficulty at hand." While Mandarin Chinese audio system moreover painting time in even
                phrases, it is not out of the ordinary to likewise make use of phrases associated with a vertical
                direction of action. For instance, the beyond can be portrayed as being "up" and the destiny as being
                "down." It might appear those differences in language convert into contrasts in execution on mental
                exams supposed to gauge how hastily a man or woman can understand worldly connections.

                <h3>Multilingualism</h3>
                Multilingualism is the use of over one language, either by a personal speaker or by a bunch of speakers.
                people that speak several languages also are called polyglots. Multilingual speakers have acquired and
                maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called first language
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <br>
                I would call myself a Polyglot since I speak, understand and write in a few languages fluently namely
                English, Hindi, Spanish, German, Urdu, Arabic (not amazingly fluent but enough for survival) and If
                regional languages and dialects are to be included Punjabi, Haryanvi, Marwari and Marathi.<br>
                and I can totally relate to the fact that learning a language isnt just about learning the grammar and
                vocabulary, you learn about the culture and the people that speak it and learning a new language opens
                up so many doors of imagination.<br>
                and when you think in a different language, you end up with a pretty different perspective.<br>

                Higher order thinking skills refers to ability to acquire and improve cognitive skills, it is indirectly
                going beyond memorizing the facts and information. This usually requires high brain storming . Sometimes
                to develop these skills we have to think out of box. Therefore, it is sometimes told us that to think,
                and to proceed in that way is much difficult. Higher order thinking skills also involves Bloom's
                Taxonomy. Many techniques are also used to enhance once higher order thinking skills.</p>

            <h3> What do we understand by Reading Skills?</h3><br>
            Reading Skills play an important role not just in improving our vocabulary , but also provides us the
            confidence to think differently, put our point of views effectively in front of others. Language skills
            (Reading Skills + Writing Skills) are an important tool in communication , listening, speaking, reading and
            writing aid in not only improving language skills but also in making communication effective. Reading skills
            are must if we need to interpret the things in the correct manner. It plays an important role in each and
            every step of life!!<br>

            <h3> What do we understand by Writing Skills:</h3> <br>
            Besides reading skills, writing skills also play a major role in ones speaking ability. What I have observed
            till now is that if ones thinking process is really great, he/she has a great mindset of imagining the
            things, then surely he/she must be good enough to pen down those thoughts. Because it is noticed every time
            that if at any point we are up with any thoughts or any ideas then immediately we pen down them no matter
            what. And sometimes to express our selves we fall short of words, in that case many people prefer to write
            instead of speaking something. Thus writing skills is the medium of expressing ones feelings, ones point of
            view and what not.

            So somewhere, whether it is indirectly or directly writing skills do play an important role.

            <h2> Mind Mapping</h2>
            <br>
            Mind mapping is an effective means to take notes and brainstorm given topics. A mind map involves writing
            down a central theme and thinking of new and related ideas which radiate out from the center.
            <br>
            Mind map is required because:-
            <br>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>It is an ideal strategy to use for your 'thinking'.</li>
                <li>Mind mapping can be used for generating, visualizing, organizing, note-taking, problem-solving,
                    decision-making, revising and clarifying a topic, so that you can get started with assessment tasks.
                </li>
                <li>Essentially, a mind map is used to brainstorm a topic and is a great strategy for students

                <br>

                Experiential learning (ExL) is the process of learning through experience, and is more specifically defined as "learning through reflection on doing".
                Hands-on learning can be a form of experiential learning, but does not necessarily involve students reflecting on their product.
                Experiential learning is distinct from rote or didactic learning, in which the learner plays a comparatively passive role.It is related to, but not synonymous with, other forms of active learning such as action learning, adventure learning, free-choice learning, cooperative learning, service-learning, and situated learning.

                <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Dependent Learners - They are the types of learners who are totally dependent on their teachers\instructor, and they exactly follow their words and instructions. They are dependent on mentor for short-short doubts, and usually prefer large groups for discussion. Also think about taking a course or a tutorial in study skills, time management, and/or reading a textbook, since these skills will help you become a more independent, confident learner.</li>
<br><li>Collaborative Learners - Collaborative learning is the educational approach of using groups to enhance learning through working together. Groups of two or more learners work together to solve problems, complete tasks, or learn new concepts. ( I personally belong to this group ^__ ^)</li>
<br><li>Autonomous Learners - these types of learners Defined as an approach to learning with which learners hold the   power or right to regulate and control their own learning activities. Learners are in charge of their own learning processes with autonomy. Autonomous learning is also called self-directed learning.</li>

<h3>What is Memorization?</h3>
<h3>What are its merits and demerits?</h3>
<br>
<p>
    Memorization is a higher order function that caches another function. It can turn some slow functions into fast ones. It saves the result of a function call after the first time to the cache, so if you call the function again with the same arguments, it will find it in the cache.
</p>
<br>
Some Merits of memorization are:
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
        Your brain gets trained to remember things
    </li>
    <li>
        Trying to remember things challenges your brain
    </li>
    <li>
        Remembering things frees up your brain to do other things
    </li>
    <li>
        It develops focus
    </li>
    <li>
        It prepares you for future learning.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
Some Demerits of memorization are:
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
        You offset learning with memorization
        Understanding is essential for success, which is affected by rote learning</li>
        <li>Stressing on remembering creates undue pressure</li>
        <li>
            It does not encourage practical implementation
        </li>
        <li>
            The absence of conceptual understanding may lead to wrongful applications.
        </li>
</ul>

<h3>Memorizing: The Feynman Technique</h3>
<img src="w9a2.jpeg" width="70%" style="border-radius: 12px; opacity: 0.9;"><br><br>
<p>
    The Feynman Technique focuses on the breaking down of complex ideas into something simpler. The technique which was named after the American physicist, Richard Feynman, also involves the use of diagrams and metaphors to make a concept easily understandable.


</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
    the Feynman technique has 4 steps:  
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>
            Choose a concept and learn about it        </li>
        <li>
            Pretend (or really) teach it to a child
        </li>
        <li>
            Review gaps in your understanding
        </li>
        <li>
            Refine, organize, and tell powerful stories
        </li>

                THE FOCUSED MODE: In this mode , the brain is "focused" and is directly able to solve problems it is familiar with. To get a better understanding of the focused mode, we can think of the analogy of how the pinball machine works. In the focused mode, the bumpers of the pin ball machine are very close and they follow a pattern, rather than randomly moving around.
               <br>
            <br>
            THE DIFFUSED MODE: If the brain is not in its focused state, it is in the diffuse mode, which is where the brain can make random connections and move freely around the bumpers as shown in the figure aside. Also, in the diffuse mode, the brain holds the relaxed approach to solving problems. Interestingly , when your brain needs to find a solution, it turns to this mode since there is a pathway to follow and because it needs to develop new thoughts.

        <p>
            Chunking means collecting different parts or chunks of information and grouping them in a larger piece of information.
<br>
Chunking is the term used to refer to the process of taking small separate pieces of information or chunks in simple words and making a group of them into larger pieces of information.
<br>
The most common application of chunking is found while remembering a phone number. Many people group the ten-digit phone numbers into two or even three groups to remember it easily. <br>For example, if a phone number is 1234567890, people will remember it more easily in the form- 1234-5678-90.

    <img src="w10a3.jpg" width="50%" style="border-radius: 12px; opacity: 0.8;"><br><br>
    <p>
Recalling refers to the simple process of remembering something without any clues and in the physical absence of that thing.

Recalling the name of a person or answering to a question are some examples of recall
<br>
In recall, all the neurons involved in the memory are activated and they reconstruct the memory.
<br>
Memory recall or retrieval is remembering the information or events that were previously encoded and stored in the brain.
<br>
Retrieval is the third step in the processing of memory , with first being the encoding of memory and second , being the storage of the memory.
<br>
There are three main types of memory recall:

<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
        Free Recall
    </li>
    <li>
     Cued Recall
    </li>
    <li>
        Serial Recall
    </li>
</ul></p>

                Collaborative learning is the educational approach of using groups to enhance learning through working together. Groups of two or more learners work together to solve problems, complete tasks, or learn new concepts.
<br>
This approach actively engages learners to process and synthesize information and concepts, rather than using rote memorization of facts and figures. Learners work with each other on projects, where they must collaborate as a group to understand the concepts being presented to them.
<br>
Through defending their positions, reframing ideas, listening to other viewpoints and articulating their points, learners will gain a more complete understanding as a group than they could as individuals.
<br>
According to Gerlach, “Collaborative learning is based on the idea that learning is a naturally social act in which the participants talk among themselves (Gerlach, 1994). It is through the talk that learning occurs.”
<br>
It is an intellectual gymnastics.

            <h2>Group Formation</h2>
            <p>
                A group refers to two or more individuals who have come together with a common objective. The members of a group interact and are interdependent on each other with the view of achieving a particular objective. Groups are of two broad categories:- formal group and informal group.
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li><h4>Formal Group</h4>
                    A group refers to two or more individuals who have come together with a common objective. The members of a group interact and are interdependent on each other with the view of achieving a particular objective. Groups are of two broad categories:- formal group and informal group.</li>
            <li>
                <h4>Informal Group</h4>
                They are those groups that do not get their definition and formation by an organization. Informal groups are neither formal structures or have an organizational determination. They are simply a group of people who have come together in an informal manner to achieve a particular goal. Examples of informal groups are family and related groups, friend groups, social peer groups, etc.</li>
