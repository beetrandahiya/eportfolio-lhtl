            <h1>Introduction and Importance of Learning</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this week we focused on learning by inquiry or to say in simple terms by asking question about something we are curious about and about our environment.<br>
                 We also learned the process of how to learn through inquiry. In this week we also have some activities. 


                <br>
                Unlearning is the process of removing knowledge from our memory in order to make room for new knowledge.
                <br>
              
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3>and Yes, Unlearning is mostly Unpleasent</h3>

                Because the realization that , what we have learned is not good enough to be useful,<br>
                or the realization that, what you had immense belief in is not in fact the right thing <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                and, Here we must ask ourselves,<br>
                <h3>What even is "Learning"?</h3><br>
                In simple words, Learning is the process of acquiring <br>
                new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.<br>
                heads up, Learning is not just studying.<br>
                Learning involves experiencing new ideas and growing with them.<br>
                Learning involves absorbing the knowledge that we come across.<br>
                Learning involves adapting new ways of thinking and acting.<br>
                and most importantly, Learning involves being open to change.<br>
                and as mentioned earlier,<br>
                Studying is a very small part of learning and not synonymous with learning.<br>

            <h1>Learning Through Inquiry</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                I discovered what inquiry-based learning entails.<br>
                It's a method of instruction that encourages pupils to engage in problem-solving and hands-on learning. <br>
                It consists of five steps: "asking, investigating, creating, discussing, and reflecting" (conclusion).
                <br>
                "Curiosity" is also the driving force behind discovery, inquiry, and learning. Inquiry-based learning, in my opinion, is a really successful way. It is a problem-based learning approach that incorporates critical thinking abilities. "Tell me and I forget," "Show me or Teach me and I will remember," and "Involve me and I will learn."

Inquiry-based learning is essentially asking questions and seeking knowledge, and it develops the habit of inquiring. It aids in the retention of knowledge. When we actively pursue details, explore information, or investigate a subject, we recall more information, which is exactly what inquiry-based learning is supposed to achieve.

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                

                <h3>Curiosity is the key to learning</h3>
                When we are curious about something that we are unaware about, we search about it through many means such as asking or looking it up on internet any many more.<br>
                This process of being curious and then investigating about the answer is known as learning by inquiry. When we are interested in something and we are unaware about it,<br>
                there are questions that pop out in our mind such as what? why? where? when? and many others, after the question comes the part where we want to know more and that's what we learn through inquiry,<br>
                learning is such a way also helps us retain the memory about our finding on that subject for a long time.<br>

                <br>
                <h3> Inquiry based Learning</h3>
<br>
                Inquiry-based learning is a learning process that engages students by making real-world connections through exploration and high-level questioning<br><br>

                <h3>1. Discussion on picture</h3>
                <img src="w2a1.jpeg" width="40%"><br>

                In this activity we were shown this picture in class and asked to describe this picture according to our perspective and talk about the things we were curious about in this picture.<br>
                It was an amazing activity as every other student had their own understanding of this picture through their own perspective. According to me, it was a very which not only gave us an great example of learning through inquiry.

                <h3>2. Discussion on the web show Social Dilemma</h3>
                <br>

                <br>In this activity we were shown the trailer of the movie "Social Dilemma" and were asked about our reviews on it.<br>
                As per my understanding, it shows us the dark side of the social media and how it has the ability to influence the minds of the general population.<br>
                It also tells us about how whatever we do can be tracked on the internet and is unsafe for us. On social media we do not have the privacy that we think that we do.<br>
                Even after knowing all about it we still use the social media sites as we are already quite addicted to them and removing them from our daily lives makes us uncomfortable and affects daily life convenience.<br>
                This activity was discussed in class and students were asked to give their views on it.<br>

            <p>
                With the vast amount of information currently disseminated on the Internet,<br> the ability to assess the credibility of online news has become essential.<br>
                While numerous researches also include fake news and tools for best discrimination, there is one caveat. A measure that focuses on using the data area to facilitate the task of the database data and messages on the Internet.<br>
                to support claims and assess the credibility of disputes. The motivation behind this test is to examine the current state of information on the use of basic speculations to detect fake news.<br>
                evaluate the validity of the information and, in particular, determine what has been done concerning the use of basic services for evaluating online messages.<br>

Process of critical thinking can be broken down into:

                <h3>Uncritical Thinking</h3>
                <br>
                IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF AN IDEA THAT SUGGESTS ITSELF AS A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM IS UNCRITICAL THINKING. <br>
                There are three types of uncritical thinking in which people don't use their own brain they just follow others.<br>
                1.THE BANDWAGON FALLACY : In this people just follow the certain group without knowing the real information.<br>
                2.THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY FALLACY : In this people just blindly follow what the fake experts try to make believe you. no matter what is the real fact.<br>
                3.THE HASTY GENERALIZATION FALLACY : In this one follow what the majority of peoplethinks or say, irrespective of the real world. <br>
