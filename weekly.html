            <h1>Introduction and Importance of Learning</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this week we focused on learning by inquiry or to say in simple terms by asking question about something we are curious about and about our environment.<br>
                 We also learned the process of how to learn through inquiry. In this week we also have some activities. 


                <br>
                Unlearning is the process of removing knowledge from our memory in order to make room for new knowledge.
                <br>
              
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3>and Yes, Unlearning is mostly Unpleasent</h3>

                Because the realization that , what we have learned is not good enough to be useful,<br>
                or the realization that, what you had immense belief in is not in fact the right thing <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                and, Here we must ask ourselves,<br>
                <h3>What even is "Learning"?</h3><br>
                In simple words, Learning is the process of acquiring <br>
                new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.<br>
                heads up, Learning is not just studying.<br>
                Learning involves experiencing new ideas and growing with them.<br>
                Learning involves absorbing the knowledge that we come across.<br>
                Learning involves adapting new ways of thinking and acting.<br>
                and most importantly, Learning involves being open to change.<br>
                and as mentioned earlier,<br>
                Studying is a very small part of learning and not synonymous with learning.<br>

            <h1>Learning Through Inquiry</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                I discovered what inquiry-based learning entails.<br>
                It's a method of instruction that encourages pupils to engage in problem-solving and hands-on learning. <br>
                It consists of five steps: "asking, investigating, creating, discussing, and reflecting" (conclusion).
                <br>
                "Curiosity" is also the driving force behind discovery, inquiry, and learning. Inquiry-based learning, in my opinion, is a really successful way. It is a problem-based learning approach that incorporates critical thinking abilities. "Tell me and I forget," "Show me or Teach me and I will remember," and "Involve me and I will learn."

Inquiry-based learning is essentially asking questions and seeking knowledge, and it develops the habit of inquiring. It aids in the retention of knowledge. When we actively pursue details, explore information, or investigate a subject, we recall more information, which is exactly what inquiry-based learning is supposed to achieve.

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                

                <h3>Curiosity is the key to learning</h3>
                When we are curious about something that we are unaware about, we search about it through many means such as asking or looking it up on internet any many more.<br>
                This process of being curious and then investigating about the answer is known as learning by inquiry. When we are interested in something and we are unaware about it,<br>
                there are questions that pop out in our mind such as what? why? where? when? and many others, after the question comes the part where we want to know more and that's what we learn through inquiry,<br>
                learning is such a way also helps us retain the memory about our finding on that subject for a long time.<br>

                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3> Inquiry based Learning</h3>
<br>
                Inquiry-based learning is a learning process that engages students by making real-world connections through exploration and high-level questioning<br><br>

                <h3>1. Discussion on picture</h3>
                <img src="w2a1.jpeg" width="40%"><br>

                In this activity we were shown this picture in class and asked to describe this picture according to our perspective and talk about the things we were curious about in this picture.<br>
                It was an amazing activity as every other student had their own understanding of this picture through their own perspective. According to me, it was a very which not only gave us an great example of learning through inquiry.

                <h3>2. Discussion on the web show Social Dilemma</h3>
                <br>

                <br>In this activity we were shown the trailer of the movie "Social Dilemma" and were asked about our reviews on it.<br>
                As per my understanding, it shows us the dark side of the social media and how it has the ability to influence the minds of the general population.<br>
                It also tells us about how whatever we do can be tracked on the internet and is unsafe for us. On social media we do not have the privacy that we think that we do.<br>
                Even after knowing all about it we still use the social media sites as we are already quite addicted to them and removing them from our daily lives makes us uncomfortable and affects daily life convenience.<br>
                This activity was discussed in class and students were asked to give their views on it.<br>

                3.THE HASTY GENERALIZATION FALLACY : In this one follow what the majority of peoplethinks or say, irrespective of the real world. <br>

            <h1>Types of Enquiry based Learning</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                My understanding of the four types of inquiries and their relevance in different stages of the learning journey?<br>
                Inquiry-based learning (additionally inquiry-based learning) begins by offering conversation starters, issues, or situations—instead of essentially introducing set up realities or depicting a smooth way to information. <br>
                
                <br>

                
                Inquiry learning includes creating questions, mentioning objective facts, doing research to discover what data is now recorded, creating strategies for tests, creating instruments for information assortment, gathering, investigating, and deciphering information, plotting potential clarifications, and making expectations for future examination.<br>
                <br>
                
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                Explicit learning measures that understudies take part in during request learning include:<br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                · Creating inquiries of their own<br>
                
                · Obtaining supporting proof to answer the question(s)<br>
                
                · Explaining the proof gathered<br>
                
                · Connecting the clarification to the information got from the analytical cycle<br>
                
                · Creating a contention and avocation for the clarification<br>
                
                </p>
                
                <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>

                <h3>Level 1: Structured Inquiry:</h3>
                
                The educator gives the underlying inquiry and a layout of the system.<br> Understudies are to define clarifications of their discoveries through assessing and investigating the information that they gather.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Level 2: Controlled Inquiry:</h3>
                
                The educator has instructed a specific science topic or point. The instructor at that point creates questions and a methodology that guides understudies through an activity where the outcomes are now known.<br> This strategy is extraordinary to fortify ideas instructed and to acquaint understudies into learning with follow techniques, gather and record information accurately and  affirm and extend understandings.<br>
                <br>    
                
                <h3>Level 3: Guided Inquiry:</h3>
                
                The instructor gives just the examination question to the understudies. The understudies are liable for planning and following their own methods to test that address and afterward impart their outcomes and discoveries.<br><br>
                
                <h3>Level 4: Free Inquiry:</h3>
                
                Understudies figure their own examination question(s), plan and finish a created strategy, and impart their discoveries and results. This sort of request is regularly found in science reasonable settings where understudies drive their own analytical inquiries.

            <h1>Learning Process</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are six interactive components of the learning process: attention, memory, language, processing, <br>and organizing, graphomotor (writing), and higher-order thinking.These processes interact not only with each other,<br>
                but also with emotions, classroom climate, behavior, social skills, teachers, and family. <br>
                <div class="line-2"></div>
                <br>
                <h3>Attention</h3>
                Focusing is the preliminary section in getting the grasp of anything. It is easy for huge component folks to attention to matters which might be charming or energizing to us.<br>
                It is difficult for huge component folks to attention to matters which might be sincerely not. When something is not exciting to us, it's miles easier to get occupied, to transport to a moreover animating difficulty or action, or dam out.<br>
                The instructor must increase physical games that accomplice with the student. Relating what's to be knowledgeable to the understudies' lives can obtain this. Relate Romeo and Juliet, for instance, to the actual elements in our networks of bias, unwarranted contempt, and posse wars. Or however relate the prevailing segregation to The Diary of Anne Frank, and feature elegant conversations of separation that understudies have surely skilled or seen.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>Memory</h3>
                Memory is the puzzling cycle that makes use of 3 systems to assist someone with getting, using, storing, and getting well facts. Youths in faculty want to do not forget altogether extra facts reliably than maximum adults do. Adults typically have extra particular days mechanics use and evaluation mechanical facts, dental specialists use and do not forget facts approximately dentistry, and so forth, Of course, faculty expects that youngsters end up specialists in more than one subject e.g., math, language, science, social assessments, an difficult to understand tongue, human articulations. <br>
                Recall that after an understudy receives something, it does not assure that he's going to do not forget it. For example, a man or woman may also draw close a shaggy dog story that he heard at a social event on Saturday night, but he may also stumble upon a problem reviewing that it whilst he endeavors to inspire it to his associates on Monday. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Language</h3>
                Language is the basic strategy by which we give and get information in school.<br> The two languages taking care of systems are expressive and open.
                Most understudies, especially those with inadequacies in made language, will benefit by using a masterminding technique for both logical and exploratory composition.<br>
                With this system, understudies at first produce considerations. Next, they may organize their contemplations. Third, they may see sentence structure. By then they take a gander at their spelling. Finally, they deal with mechanical and syntactic rules.<br>
                It is in like manner valuable for understudies to list their most as frequently as conceivable happening goofs in a diary and imply this summary when self-redressing.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>Organization</h3>
                We measure and sort out information in two guideline ways: coordinated (spatial) and reformist (sequential).<br>
                Practicing accommodating learning grants each understudy's dealing with and figuring out characteristics to be utilized to the upside of the social occasion. For example, the people who are strong in simultaneous affiliation may make the get-together's blueprint, visual, or map, and those strong in reformist affiliation may be the task step facilitators, the military instructors, watches, and speed setters.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Higher-Order Thinking</h3>
                Higher solicitation/order thinking (HOT) is beyond simply recalling real factors or related information in the same words the educator or book sends them. Higher solicitation thinking requires that we achieve something with current real factors. We need to understand and control the information.<br>
                HOT joins thought plan; thought affiliation; basic reasoning; understanding the "higher point of view"; envisioning; creativity; tending to; determining; innovative, smart, and feasible thinking; and metacognition.<br> Metacognition is mulling over deduction, pondering knowing, and knowing how you think, measure information, and learn.<br>
                All understudies will benefit by advance facilitators that relate the higher point of view and the standard plans to be covered. Moreover, all understudies ought to be unequivocally urged how to gather thought maps (reasonable organizers that partner all pieces of a thought, and may in like manner interface one plan to another thought).<br>
